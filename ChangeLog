	* age-data-processing.R (main): Wrap the script in a main function
	so the distinction between the script and the functions is.

	proportion of the census tract population that is at least 60
	years of age as one of the summary statistics.

	* spatial-area-merge.R: Attempt to read the census tracks from a
	local file rather than downloading if possible. Include a check
	that the covariates file is available before proceeding with the
	computation.
	(iterate_merging): Include a progress bar showing elapsed time and
	an estimate of the remaining time.
